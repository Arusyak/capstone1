    <p><br>
      As in the previous tasks, in this task, you will see a series of randomly generated 8x8 matrices with 0s and 1s. Your task is to count how many times "1" appears in the matrix. This task
        will last 300 seconds (5 minutes).
      </p>
      <p>
      Before we begin with the task, you will have to choose 
      whether your allowance will depend on your <b>individual performance</b> (as in Task 1) or your <b>compared performance</b> (as in Task 2).
    </p>

    <p>
      If Task 3 is randomly selected to determine your allowance, then:

      <ul>
    <li>If you choose <i><b>individual performance</b></i> your performance <b>will not be compared to others</b> and you will receive 1 point per problem you solve correctly (as in Task 1).</li>
    <li>If you choose the <i><b>compared performance</b></i> your performance will be compared to the <b>Task 2 performance of the other three participants in your group</b>.
        If you are the individual with the highest score, you will receive 4 points for
            each correct calculation. If your score is equal to the highest score of another participant from your group,
            a single player will be randomly chosen as the winner.
       If you are not this individual, you will receive zero points in this task. </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

        <b>For each point, your allowance will increase by 4 AED.</b>
