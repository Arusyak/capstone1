    <p><br>
      As in the previous tasks, in this task, you will see a randomly generated matrix with 0s and 1s. Your task is to count how many times "1" appears in the matrix.
      </p>
      <p>
      Before we begin with the task, you will have to choose 
      whether your allowance depends on your <b>individual performance</b> (as in Task 1) or your <b>compared performance</b> (as in Task 2).
    </p>

    <p>
      If Task 3 is randomly selected to determine your allowance, then:

      <ul>
    <li>If you choose <i><b>individual performance</b></i> your performance <b>will not be compared to others</b> and you will receive 1 point per problem you solve correctly (as in Task 1).</li>
    <li>If you choose the <i><b>compared performance</b></i> your performance will be compared to that of <b>the other three participants in your group from Task 2</b>.
        If you are the individual with the highest score, you will receive 4 points for
            each correct addition. If your score is equal to the highest score of another participant from your group,
            a single player will be randomly chosen as the winner.
       If you are not this individual, you will receive zero points in this task. </li>
      </ul>
     </p>

      <p>
        <b>For each point, your allowance will increase by 5 AED.</b>
