    <p>
      You are now taking part in an experiment.  You will receive a subsistence allowance which will depend on decisions made in the experiment, with a minimum allowance of 30 AED.
      It is therefore important that you read the instructions carefully as they explain how your decisions will affect the allowance you receive at the end of today's session. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You cannot use any electronic devices or communicate with others throughout the experiment. Violation of this rule will disqualify you from payment.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you complete parts of the experiment you will receive a score expressed in "points". <b>1 point is equivalent to 5 AED</b>. Your allowance will be paid in UAE Dirhams (AED) in private at the end of the session. No one will be informed about your decisions in the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment will take approximately 40 minutes and participant allowance is expected to average 100 AED, though you may earn significantly more or less. The average allowance includes participation allowance which is 30 AED.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the experiment you will be asked to complete three different tasks. No task will take more than 6 minutes. At the end of the experiment one of the tasks will be randomly selected, and you will be paid based on your performance in that task.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before each task you will receive specific instructions. These instructions will explain how you make decisions, and how your decisions and the decisions of other participants influence your allowance. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the experiment is over, you will be asked to fill out a questionnaire.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please raise your hand and alert an experimenter if you have any questions.
